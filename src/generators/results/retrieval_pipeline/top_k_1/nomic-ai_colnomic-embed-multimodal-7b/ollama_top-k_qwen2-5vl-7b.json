This reduction is part of a broader strategy to achieve net zero emissions by 2050. The document also notes that the automotive sector is a key driver for the transition to electric vehicles (EVs), which are expected to reduce emissions intensity. However, the document does not provide a specific numerical contribution of low carbon transport to overall emission reduction.",
