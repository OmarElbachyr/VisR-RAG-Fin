    "predicted": "The Fourth Industrial Revolution (4IR) is expected to bring significant changes to the financial sector, impacting both financial institutions and fintech companies. The context suggests that the 4IR will introduce new technologies that combine the physical, digital, and biological worlds, which will dramatically change the way humans interact and operate. This revolution is expected to introduce efficiency gains to personal and business lives, as well as transform operating models into new digital models.\n\nFinancial institutions and fintech companies will face issues such as:\n\n1. **Shifting Customer Expectations**: As customer expectations are shifting due to the 4IR, financial institutions and fintech companies will need to adapt their products and services to meet these new expectations. This includes enhancing products with data to improve asset productivity and forming new partnerships to compete and collaborate.\n\n2. **Inertia of Tradition**: The inertia of traditional practices and systems can be a barrier to adopting new technologies and models. This is particularly relevant for financial institutions that may be resistant to change.\n\n3. **Automation and Radicalization**: The potential for automation and the radicalization of certain sectors could lead to a mismatch between supply and demand, affecting wages and job security. This could lead to a darker view of workers' lives and a need for central bankers to worry more about inflation.\n\n4. **Inequality and Inflation**: The 4IR could exacerbate existing inequalities and lead to inflation. Financial institutions and fintech companies will need to manage these issues by expanding the base of 'haves' through diversified investments and ensuring savings are appropriately exposed to diversified, inexpensive, and professional capital ownership.\n\n5. **Environmental Impact**: The transition to renewable energy sources will likely increase the cost of energy, which could impact the overall economy and the financial sector. Financial institutions and fintech companies will need to adapt to these changes and consider the environmental impact of their operations.\n\nIn summary, financial institutions and fintech companies will need to adapt to the rapid technological changes brought by the 4IR, manage the associated economic and social impacts, and ensure they are prepared for the future challenges and opportunities presented by this revolution.",
