While both countries experienced declines, the severity of the drop and the subsequent recovery were markedly different, with the UK holding up much better.",

The floor area estimate is linked to the energy consumption of the property (measured in kWh/sqm/year). Higher energy consumption leads to a higher floor area estimate.\n\n2.  **Carbon Factor:** The carbon factor (expressed as a percentage) is applied to the energy consumption. It represents the greenhouse gas emissions associated with the energy source used. A higher carbon factor translates to a larger impact on the overall emissions calculation.\n\n3.  **Floor Area Estimate:** This is the direct output of the assessment process. It’s influenced by the combination of energy consumption and the carbon factor.\n\n**In summary, the market value of real estate properties is assessed based on the energy efficiency and the emissions associated with that energy use.**\n\nLet me know if you'd like a deeper dive into any particular aspect!",

Central banks typically raise interest rates to combat inflation.
