Calculate the difference between the final value and the initial value.\n   - Difference = Final value - Initial value\n   - Difference = 121% - 147%\n   - Difference = -26%\n\n3. Calculate the percentage change by dividing the difference by the initial value and multiplying by 100.\n   - Percentage change = (Difference / Initial value) * 100\n   - Percentage change = (-26% / 147%) * 100\n   - Percentage change ≈ -17.83%\n\nTherefore, the percentage change in the BPCE group customer loan/deposit ratio between December 2010 and December 2014 was approximately -17.83%.",
