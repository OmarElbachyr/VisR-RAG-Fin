Complementing this process, the\nGroup produces several heat maps, informing the materiality\nassessment. Climate scenario analyses are performed and\nintegrated in the ICAAP. At counterparty and transaction Level,\nESG performance and associated risks are also analysed\nthrough the ESG Assessment which is fully integrated into the\ncredit process.\n\nMf Risk management: solutions & adaptation\n\nTo closely control the risk exposure towards sectors particularly\nexposed to ESG matters, the Group has issued financing and\ninvestment policies, classified as sector policies. Group credit\nrelated policies have also been reinforced considering ESG\ndimensions.\n\nExclusion & monitoring lists restrict the activity or increase the\nlevel of scrutiny placed towards specific sectors or activities\n(see Part |. Section 1.3 Committed to a net zero economy by\n2050: BNP Paribas monitors its financing and investment\nactivities).\n\nBesides, climate-related criteria are incorporated as relevant\nin the due diligence performed on customers and suppliers, in\ncovenants and procedures related to new/modified activities\nand exceptional transactions.\n\nPortfolios are dynamically managed towards the alignment\ntargets defined by the Group (see Part IV.

Also, climate factors are incorporated\ninto the Group's Risk Appetite Statement (RAS). The Group's\nRAS is defined consistently with the strategy of BNP Paribas\nand includes risk principles dedicated to ESG risks drivers\n(climate-related elements are included). These risk principles,\ncoupled with dedicated metrics, define the risk tolerance\nof the Group on these dimensions. For example, the Group\nRAS integrates five metrics with limits to control the Group\nachievements with respect to its commitments on thermal\nCoal and Oil & Gas upstream financing for 2025 and 2030. In\naddition, complementary indicators, resulting from the Net-\nZero targets setting regarding the Oil & Gas, Power Generation\nand Automotive sectors, and the Low-Carbon Financing are\npart of the Risk Appetite Statement for monitoring purposes\n(see Part IV. Section 1.

    "chunk": "III - RISK MANAGEMENT\n\n2.3 Assessing potential impacts of climate risks through climate scenario analyses and\n\nStress testing\n\nOver the past few years, BNP Paribas has built a robust\nplatform for stress testing and financial simulations covering\nall risk types and business lines. The Group has also developed\ncapabilities to assess the potential impact of climate scenarios\non the credit quality of corporate clients and the geolocation oj\nreal estate to assess the impact of physical risk events (such\nas riverine flood). Exercises based on scenarios have increased\nin number, diversity, and sophistication.\n\nn 2020-2021, BNP Paribas took part in the pilot program\nconducted by the French ACPR (Prudential Supervision and\nResolution Authority), which applied “shocks”, taken from\ndifferent NGFS (Network for Greening the Financial System)\nclimate risks scenarios, to the risk parameters. The objective\nwas to estimate the possible impact of the transition and\nphysical risks on bank balance sheets and in terms of expected\noss. In early 2022, BNP Paribas participated in a European\nexercise supervised by the ECB.\n\nn 2023, BNP Paribas contributed to the EBA Fit-for-55 Climate\nStress Test by providing specific climate data on the clients.\nThe Group has also developed internal simulations both on\ntransition and physical risks that contribute to its capital\nadequacy assessment. It is worth noting that some stress\ntests use the current exposures of the Bank without taking into\naccount any future change or adaptation, while others allow\nthe use of a dynamic balance sheet approach, reflecting both\nthe public commitments taken by the institutions and the\ntransition impacts on the banking books.\n\nClimate scenario analysis is an integral part of the Group's risk\nmanagement and financial steering system, in which climate-\n\nrelated risks are fully integrated. As such, the Group’s Internal\nCapital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) incorporates\nclimate-related risks analysis. The exercises carried out so far\nshow relatively limited impacts at Group level for scenarios\nwhere the transition is successfully implemented, and the\ncollective net zero objective is reached by 2050. Under these\nscenarios, physical risk impacts also have limited financial\nconsequences for the Bank, even ona relatively long-term basis.\nThey do, however, allow for the identification of exposures in\nsome sectors and countries that would face higher risk under\nthese scenarios.\n\nIn 2023 BNP Paribas has tested its corporate portfolio against\nthree transition scenarios: the Integrated Assessment Model\n(IAM), the Regional Model of Investment and Development\n(REMIND) below 2°C (Orderly scenario) and delayed transition\n(Disorderly scenario), and current policies scenarios for which\nthe NGFS has provided scenario-conditional pathways of both\nmacro-economic and climate variables in late 2022.\n\nThe projection of the Cost of Risk (CoR) until 2050 is performed\nwith the Bank's internal modelling framework. First, the latter\nencompasses a dynamic balance sheet module that enables to\nreflect sectoral reallocation of the Bank's unsecured portfolio\nbut also EPC mix change on the secured by real-estate\nportfolio. Moreover, the framework Leverages on an in-house\nsolution that generates credit rating change at client-level in\norder to account for credit worthiness evolution in adequacy\nwith the scenario.\n\nDASHBOARD | Relative impacts of an orderly (below 2°C ) and a disorderly (delayed transition) scenario vs. current policies\n\nscenario per region and sector\n\nThe results of the stress test are illustrated in the dashboard\nbelow for corporates. Each geographical area has a weight\nequivalent to its share in the total exposure of the portfolio.\nThe surface associated to each sector (or group of sectors), as\ndefined in the Statistical Classification of Economic Activities in\nthe European Community (NACE codes), is proportional to its\nweight in the total exposure to the corresponding geographical\narea.\n\n34\n\nThe indicator used is the relative increase in the total Cost of\nRisk in percentage of the Exposure at Default (EaD) between\nthe current policies scenario and the other scenarios at 2040\nwhen the transition is in full swing.

Together with the deployment of low carbon financing\nat scale, we expect the security of natural gas supplies to\nremain high on the European countries’ agenda in years to\ncome.\n\nAs of 31 December 2023, exposure to upstream Oil and Gas\nrepresented c. 0.4% and exposure to upstream Oil and Gas\nand refining represented c. 0.8% of BNP Paribas’ total gross\nexposure to credit risk.\n\n™ OPERATIONAL METRICS: UPSTREAM OIL AND\nUPSTREAM GAS CREDIT EXPOSURE\n\nBNP Paribas first introduced in 2021 and then reinforced in\n2022 a set of 2025 objectives to reduce its credit exposure to\nthe upstream Oil and Gas activities.\n\nIn January 2023, this ambition was substantially strengthened\nand extended to 2030: BNP Paribas has committed to reduce\nits upstream Oil financing to less than EUR 1 billion by 2030,\nie. an 80% decrease compared to its exposure amount of\nEUR 5 billion at the end of September 2022.\n\n2 Source : IEA - https://iea.blob.core.windows.net/assets/2f65984e-73ee-40ba-a4d5-\nbb2e2c94cecb/EmissionsfromOilandGasOperationinNetZeroTransitions.pdf\n\nUpstream Oil: 5.0\nUpstream Gas: 5.3\n\n44\n\n< 1.0 (-80%)\n= 37 (-30%)\n\nCredit exposure to upstream\nOil and Gas in EUR billion\n\nThe Group has similary committed to decrease its upstream\nGas financing (EUR 5.3 billion at the end of September 2022)\nby more than 30% by 2030.\n\nThe Group also decided to no longer provide any financing\ndedicated to the development of new Oil and Gas fields,\nregardless of the financing method (project financing, reserve-\nbased lending, FPSO)*, nor to non-diversified upstream Oil\nplayers.\n\nAs of end 2023, BNP Paribas had already exceeded its 2025\nupstream Oil and Gas and upstream Oil financing reduction\ntargets (respectively -12% and -25%) vs. December 2020, with\nactual reductions of -37% and -43%. It is also well on track\nwith its 2030 objectives as can be seen in the table on the\nfollowing page.\n\nm FINANCED EMISSIONS METRIC\n\nIn order to better measure and monitor the impact of its\npivot away from financing fossil fuels and towards financing\nlow-carbon energies, the Group is introducing a financed\nemissions indicator for its Oil and Gas portfolio, together with\nan associated 2030 reduction target. The baseline is set at\n30 September 2022, which is in line with the baseline for\nthe Bank's 2030 upstream Oil and Gas exposure reduction\ntargets.\n\nThe financed emissions indicator builds on the PCAF\nmethodology and is specifically tailored to measure and\n\nAttribution factors are computed for upstream and refining\nentities using outstanding (drawn) amounts and balance\nsheet items (equity and debt). The attribution factor is subject\nto a certain degree of inherent volatility related to year-on-\nyear fluctuations in company values or changing drawing\npatterns. In order to reduce potential distortion associated\nwith company book fluctuations, the attribution factors are\ncomputed using 3-year averages for equity and debt.\n\nThe 2030 financed emissions target is set at 8.2 MtCO,e,\nrepresenting a 70% reduction compared to a September 2022\nbaseline of 27.3 MtCO,e. The target is benchmarked against\nthe IEA NZE scenario which involves a reduction in Oil and\nGas emissions of 34% between 2022 and 2030. It also takes\ninto account the Group’s objectives in terms of reducing\nupstream exposure as well as its targets to reduce the weight\nof the fossil fuel financing in its energy production financing\nportfolio to 10% by 2030. As of end of 2023, the metric stood\nat 15.9 MtCO,e, representing a 42% reduction vs. the baseline.\n\nOverview of Oil and Gas operational metric\n\n-43% -25%\n\nUpstream Oil Credit Exposure Dec 31, 2020\n\nUpstream Oil and Gas Credit Exposure Dec 31, 2020\n\nUpstream Oil Credit Exposure\n\nUpstream Gas Credit Exposure\n\nOverview of Oil and Gas financed emissions metric\n\n27.3\n\nFinanced emissions (MtCO,e) (baseline)\n\n-37% -12%\n\nSep 30,2022 -40%(EUR3.0bn) -80%\nSep 30,2022 -34%(EUR3.5bn)  -30%\n\nSep 30, 2022 | oases | 2030 Target\n\n15.9 82\n(-42%) (-70%)\n\nWhile replacing the earlier emission intensity metric, which\nhas become obsolete at portfolio level in the context of\nthe strong acceleration of the Group’s upstream exposure\nreduction targets, BNP Paribas intends to continue to use the\noperational emission intensities indicators for its internal\nassessment of individual Oil and Gas companies’ performance.\n\nThe Group’s financed emission indicator is subject to certain\nlimitations usual for this kind of metrics (use of estimates,\npotential reporting date mismatches, etc.). It has been tailored\nto measure the impact of the Group’s upstream exposure\nreduction strategy and as such may not be comparable\nwith other similar metrics, including the financed emissions\nreported under Pillar 3 or other reporting requirements.\n\nThe financed emissions indicator formula reads (simplified):\n\nDrawn amounts ,\n\nFinanced emissions metric = 3 emissions, x cf\n(Equity + Debt),\n\nc = company\n\nNote: The Group's financed\nemissions metric is computed\nusing the following data sources:\n\n+ CO, and CH, emissions for scopes\n1 and 2 (MtCO,e per annum)\nare taken from Wood Mackenzie\nfor each upstream or refining\ncounterparty.\n\n+ CO, emissions for scope 3\nare calculated based on O8&G\nvolumes extracted by each\ncounterparty, using data sourced\nfrom Wood Mackenzie to which\nEmission factors computed using\nIPCC 2006 and IEA data are\napplied.\n\n+ Equity and Debt = company data\nconsolidated by BNP Paribas,\nthree-year averages.\n\nBNP Paribas' 2030 target is more ambitious than the IEA NZE scenario which involves a\n\nreduction in Oil and Gas emissions of 34% between 2022 and 2030.\n\nBNP Paribas partnership with Kayrros\n\nmonitor the impact of the\nstrategy in terms of absolute\n2 emissions for upstream and\n3 emissions for upstream (en\n\nGroup's exposure reduction\nemissions.

Kayrros uses artificial intelligence to process satellite images and track global methane emissions in near\nreal time. BNP Paribas teams intend to build on these methane tracking technologies to work towards developing more\n\naccurate industry-level methane metrics using different modelling techniques, including geospatial data analytics. The Group\nwill leverage Kayrros’ expertise to deepen its understanding of the methane footprint and enhance its engagement with oil\nand gas companies. The project aims to supplement the existing corpus of knowledge on methane emissions quantification\nwhile promoting best practices in data measurement, analysis and reporting. Its aim is to effectively contribute to the toolkit\navailable to banks to measure their progress towards the methane abatement goals of IPCC (AR6).\n\n45",

    "chunk": "Within the building utilization phase, the scope aligns with\nthe Group's definition of the real estate sector, which excludes\nowner-occupied real estate. It therefore focuses on emissions\nfrom buildings owned by real estate investors, including their\ntenants’ emissions, under a whole-building approach.\n\nFor secured lines, the emissions are measured at asset pro-\nperty Level, while for unsecured financing the emissions are\nmeasured at property portfolio level, as disclosed by the Real\nEstate Trust Investments (REITs).\n\nFinancial scope\n\nThe Group prioritized its largest markets and portfolios where\nsufficient data could be obtained:\n\n- Secured financing portfolios of CIB EMEA and Commercial &\nPersonal Banking in France\n\n- Unsecured-REITs financing portfolio of CIB in EMEA and\nCommercial & Personal Banking in France and Belgium\n\nAs of December 31, 2022, exposure to the Commercial Real\nEstate sector represented c. 1.4% of BNP Paribas total financing.\n\nMetrics\n\nThe chosen metric is an emission intensity, defined as kilogram\nof CO,e per square metre. To come to an aggregated metric,\nemission intensities are weighted by loan exposures.\n\nData sources\n\nFor the secured portfolio, the Bank has leveraged on collected\nEnergy Performance Certificates (EPCs) that are directly re-\nlated to the collateralized assets. This was complemented by\ninformation obtained from public databases, e.g. ADEME and\nBase des Notaires in France. Where no direct emission inten-\nsity was provided on the EPC, energy intensity or labels were\nconverted by using national emission factors and appropriate\nEPC scales.\n\nFor the unsecured-REITs portfolio, the Bank has mostly leve-\nraged the information disclosed by clients in their annual /\nsustainability reports. When available, market-based informa-\ntion was used.\n\nWhere no specific asset or company data was available, the\nBank used additional assumptions by leveraging existing data\non similar assets (considering at least country and building\ntype), or on a proxy basis (using ADEME).\n\nThe availability of the EPC information varies strongly between\ncountries. There is a high dependency on a country’s regula-\ntions (including privacy laws) and data infrastructure. As a re-\nsult, in certain markets, the data collection has been limited\nto such an extent that these markets could not be included in\nscope today.\n\nm BENCHMARK METHODOLOGY & TARGET SETTING\n\nBNP Paribas uses CRREM scenario V2.02, as it provides granu-\nlar decarbonisation pathways at a country and building - type\n\nCountries’ submissions to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change\nunder the With Existing Measures (WEM) scenarios, which account for domestic policies\nand measures already in place.\n\n56\n\nIV - METRICS, TARGETS & ALIGNMENT PROGRESS: MONITORING THE ACCELERATION TO NET ZERO BY 2050\n\nlevel. This granularity allows the Group to take into account\nthe diverse starting points across building types and countries\nand to monitor our clients’ progress by comparing to the rele-\nvant decarbonisation curves. The CRREM provides fully aligned\n1.5°C decarbonization pathways for the real estate sector.\n\nWhile the Bank aims at maintaining a stable benchmark al-\nowing to track and compare progress over time, it also antici-\npates that the portfolio composition may change in the future.\nlf a material change in the portfolio mix occurs, BNP Paribas\nmay adjust the benchmark to ensure it remains representa-\ntive for the underlying asset types and countries. In addition,\nBNP Paribas aims to improve its data quality and coverage\nor the sector. This could also result in an adjustment to the\nbenchmark.\n\nBNP Paribas’ 2030 commitment for the\nCommercial Real Estate sector\n\nBNP Paribas CRREM\nEmission intensity\n(kgCO,e/m?) BENCHMARK V2.02\n23.4]\n-41% to -31%\n16.7 - 19.5 -55%\na\n2022 2030 2022 2030\n@ Baseline WECRREM V2.02 Benchmark\n@ 2030 Target\n\nAt end-2022, BNP Paribas’ emission intensity on the covered\nCommercial Real Estate scope was 28.4 kgCO,e/m?, which is\n6% below the comparable CRREM benchmark. The portfolio\nbenefits from an exposure to large Real Estate Investors, whose\nassets, on average, exhibit a slightly better performance than\nthe 2022 CRREM benchmark.\n\nBNP Paribas sets an intermediate target for 2030 in the form\nof a range of 16.7 to 19.5 kgCO,e/m?, representing a reduction\nrange of 41% to 31%.\n\nThis reduction range remains lower than what the CRREM\nV2.02 trajectory would prescribe for 2030. The set target range\nreflects the current projections by the relevant countries for\ntheir building and energy sectors under existing national\nmeasures’, factoring in a degree of uncertainty as well as an\nactive steering of the Group’s portfolio.\n\nThe Group’s ability to achieve the target is highly dependent on\nfactors that are outside the control of BNP Paribas, such as the\nevolution of the energy mix within countries, the development\nof local EPC regulations, or the national net zero transition\nstrategies for the real estate sector.\n\n57\n\nm™ DECARBONISATION ENABLERS\n\nAs noted, the sector's transition is heavily reliant on retrofitting\nthe existing building stock. When considering operational\nemissions, this can be achieved through 2 main Levers: by\nreducing energy consumption and by sourcing cleaner energy.\n\nReducing the energy consumption\nthrough energy efficiency and mana-\ngement measures (e.g. high quality\nisolation, improved systems efficiency,\nadjusting to consumption patterns).\n\nBuilding’s energy\nconsumption\n\nSourcing low to zero emitting ener-\ngies for building operations (e.g. green\nelectricity, bio energy):\n\n- At building level, it requires adap-\ntations to allow for cleaner energy\nsourcing (e.g. electrification of hea-\n\nEnergy source & ting). The owner may also be able\n\nmix to ensure sourcing of green energy\nfrom its suppliers.\n\n- At location / country level, it re-\nquires decarbonisation of the power\ngeneration mix (this lever is howe-\nver not in the hands of building\nowners).\n\nBNP Paribas identified several transition levers that it aims\nto implement. For instance, Commercial & Personal Banking\nin France will increase its share of financing of green assets\n(following EU Taxonomy, FrenchRE2020 and/or high scores\nunder well-established independent sustainable assessment\nmethods). The origination teams across the Bank will include\nclimate impact as a decision criterion in their business\ndecisions. With respect to the unsecured financing to REIT\nclients, BNP Paribas will monitor their climate targets and\nsupport them in their net zero trajectory.",

    "chunk": "13 Committed to a net zero economy by 2050: BNP Paribas monitors its financing and\n\ninvestment activities\n\nSECTOR FINANCING AND INVESTMENT POLICIES\n\nSince 2010, as part of the implementation of its strategy to\ncombat climate change, BNP Paribas has developed ESG\nfinancing and investment sector policies covering eight\nsectors?, including the energy sectors with the largest impact\non climate change. These restrictive policies lay down strict\nESG criteria, including some related to climate. The policies\nare regularly updated: for instance, in 2023, the Group\nexcluded all financing for projects related to the extraction o\nthe metallurgical coal.\n\nRegarding the energy sector, following the announcement in\n2020 of a strategy for a full exit from the thermal coal value\nchain by 2030 in the European Union and OECD countries, and\nby 2040 in the rest of the world, BNP Paribas conducted a\ncomprehensive analysis of its clients portfolio.\n\nIn 2017, BNP Paribas stopped supporting companies whose\nprimary business is exploration, production and export o;\ngas/oil from shale oil, from tar sands or gas/oil production in\nthe Arctic. In 2022, BNP Paribas also tightened its financing\nrestrictions in particularly sensitive ecosystems such as the\nArctic and the Amazon.\n\nIn 2023, the Group accelerated again its exit from fossil fuels:\nBNP Paribas no longer grants financing for the development\nof new oil or gas projects, regardless of the financing terms\n(project financing, reserve-based lending, FPSO), nor to non-\ndiversified players in oil exploration and production.\n\nACTIVITY MONITORING AND EXCLUSION LIST\n\nTo identify the companies with the highest environmental\nrisks, in addition to sector financing and investment policies,\nBNP Paribas manages an activity monitoring and exclusion List.\nThe clients under monitoring are subject to close supervision\nto ensure that they are transitioning their activities toward\nlower emitting business practices. The Group prohibits any\nnew business relationship with companies under exclusion. At\nthe end of 2023, the number of companies under monitoring\nwas 286, while the number under exclusion reached 1,432.\n\nVIGILANCE PLAN\n\nSince the adoption of the French Duty of Care Law in 2017,\nBNP Paribas is implementing a vigilance plan to identify and\nprevent the risks of serious violations to human rights and\nfundamental freedoms, harm to human health and safety, and\nharm to the environment. It applies to all employees, activities,\nsubsidiaries controlled by the Group, including suppliers and\nsubcontractors, and is published in the Group's Universal\nRegistration Document each year.\n\nIn BNP Paribas’ vigilance plan’, climate change and energy\ntransition stood out in the materiality matrix that classifies\naround a hundred extra-financial topics according to their\nrelevance for the Group’s internal and external stakeholders.\nThe Group's vigilance approach includes the risk of harm to\nthe environment, considering climate physical and transition\nrisks, and GHG emissions (CO,, methane, and others).\n\n? https:/group.bnpparibas/en/our-commitments/transitions/financing-and-investment-policies\n3 BNP Paribas Universal Registration Document and Annual Financial report 2023, page 704\n\nFOCUS | Accelerating in the financing of the energy\ntransition\n\nAs of 30 September 2023, BNP Paribas’ financing of\nlow-carbon energies had reached EUR 32 billion, repre-\nsenting a total of 65% of the Group's financing to energy\nproduction. Within the financing for low-carbon energy,\nrenewables accounted for EUR 28.8 billion, an increase of\nEUR 4 billion in one year due to an increase in financing of\nrenewables across all client segments (utilities, non power\ncompanies, households). Exposure to nuclear and biofuels\nremained stable over the last year. By 2030, the Group\nnow targets 90% of its energy financing towards low-car-\nbon.\n\nThis low-carbon exposure covers drawn and committed\nundrawn amounts. It has been built as an addition of five\nexposures:\n\n= Exposure to renewable power generation from power\ngeneration actors: this computation is based on the re-\nnewable share in the power generation capacity mix of\neach legal entity as provided by the data provider Asset\nImpact.\n\nExposure to nuclear power generation from power gene-\nration actors (utilities, renewable developers and ope-\nrators): this computation is based on the nuclear share\nin the power generation capacity mix of each legal en-\ntity as provided by the data provider Asset Impact.\n\nExposure to renewable power generation: some transac-\ntion can come from non-power generation actors such\nas supermarkets, IT companies, etc. when such compa-\nnies are developing a renewable project, the transac-\ntion is identified and included in the calculation.\nExposure to renewable power generation from\nhouseholds: it is based on identified renewable transac-\ntions in the Bank's internal systems.\n\nExposure to biofuels: it is based on biofuels’ industry\ncode in the Bank’s internal systems.\n\nFinancing for low-carbon energy and fossil fuels\n\nCredit facilities + contingent liabilities + securities on balance sheet, in billions of euros, at 30 September 2022 and 30 September 2023.\n\nAs of now, the broader low-carbon ecosystem (renewable\nmanufacturers, hydrogen, storage, etc.) is not taken into\naccount.\n\nAdditionally BNP Paribas has already implemented or ini-\ntiated an exit trajectory for each of the fossil energies:\n\n= An already very advanced exit from thermal coal, defini-\ntive by 2030 in the European Union and the OECD, and\nby 2040 in the rest of the world.\n\nA fully completed exit from non-conventional hydrocar-\nbon specialists: in 2017, BNP Paribas stopped suppor-\nting companies whose primary business is exploration,\nproduction and export of gas or oil from shale oil and\ngas and from tar sands specialists. In 2022, BNP Paribas\nalso tightened its financing restrictions in particularly\nsensitive ecosystems such as the Arctic and the Ama-\nzon‘.\n\nIn the oil sector, BNP Paribas will reduce its financing of\n\noil exploration and production by 80% by 2030, compared\n\nto end of September 2022, as follows:\n\n= The end of financing purely dedicated to the develop-\nment of new oil fields regardless of the financing me-\nthods (project financing, reserve-based lending, FPSO).\n\nThe phasing out of financing for non-diversified oil\nupstream players (independent oil companies) and in-\ntended to support oil production (corporate financing\nor reserve-based Lending).\n\nThe reduction of general purpose lending allocated to\noil upstream.\n\nAs regards gas exploration and production, BNP Paribas\nalso excludes all financing dedicated to the development\nof new capacities. The amount of financing for gas\nexploration and production will be reduced by more than\n30% by 2030 compared to the end of September 2022. The\nGroup may contribute to the financing of new-generation\nthermal power plants with low emission rates as well as,\nif necessary, of the infrastructure needed for security of\nsupply (gas terminals, gas transportation fleet, etc.), to\ntake into account current geopolitical factors.\n\n2022\n\nlow-carbon Fossil fuels\n\n1 Renewables\nHH Biofuels\nNuclear\n\n© Refining\n\n1B Upstream Gas\nHB Upstream Oil\nHH Coal\n\nlow-carbon Fossil fuels\n\n4 See our oil and gas policy: https:/group.bnpparibas/uploads/file/bnpparibas_csr_sector_policy_oil_gas.pdf",

To fully appreciate this,\nwe first need to better understand our water footprint.\n\nA common good and a\nfundamental right\n\nby Guillaume Poupy,\n\nCSR Group, BNP Paribas\n\nFresh water is vital for the functioning\nof animals and plants, ecosystems and\norganisations. Here, a useful conceptual\nframework can be found in the different\n“values” of water - as a human right, an\neconomic asset, an essential element of\necosystems and a natural risk factor.\n\nFirst of all, water is a human right. In 2010,\nthe UN recognised “access to safe and clean\ndrinking water and sanitation facilities” as\na human right that is BJ \"essential for the\nfull enjoyment of life and all human rights”\nWater is central to the Hi sixth Sustainable\nDevelopment Goal: ensuring access for all\nto sustainably managed water services and\nsanitation.\n\nWater is also a crucial asset for economic\nactivities, starting with agriculture, which\naccounts for 72% of withdrawals. Indus-\ntry represents around 10% and the energy\nsector, which is equally important for the\neconomy, is approximately 5%. Water and\nenergy are highly interlinked: water is es-\nsential for producing electricity and hydro-\ncarbons, and energy is needed to purify and\ntransport water.\n\nMoreover, water is key for ecosystem func-\ntioning and all forms of life. Aquatic ecosys-\ntems - for instance, wetlands, lakes, rivers,\netc. - are among the richest in biodiversity,\nbut they are the most vulnerable to human\nactivity such as aridification and pollution\n\nLastly, fresh water is at the core of natu-\nral risks, including floods, droughts, storms\nand wildfires. According to UNEP, & over\n90% of natural disasters are related_to\nwater.\n\nRecognising our water footprint\n\nThe climate crisis is an established fact, but water challenges are still largely under-\nestimated and poorly understood.\n\nAlthough a person physically needs no more than 2 litres of water a day, our hygiene\nroutines require far more ‘blue gold’: between 5 and 10 litres per toilet flush, and from\n50 to 100 litres for a shower. In total, our domestic consumption is estimated to be\naround 140 litres per day, with geographical variations depending on Lifestyles. This is a\nsubstantial amount of water globally, given a population of over 8 billion people. Yet this\nis actually only a fraction of our water consumption.\n\nWhen we put on a pair of jeans in the morning, do we realise that possibly up to 11,000\nlitres of water were needed to make them? And when we make ourselves a cup of coffee,\nare we aware that is the same as ‘virtually’ consuming around 140 litres of water? And\nwhat about the water costs of exchanging dozens of emails every day or our generative\nAl requests? Virtual water is a fairly new concept, but it can be crucial when we try\nto understand water issues holistically. The concept covers all the water consumption\nnecessary for a product or a service. Much like a carbon footprint, it enables people to\ncalculate their water footprint.\n\nClimate change is accelerating the water cycle and negatively impacting available re-\nsources. So a better understanding of water issues and real consumption levels can\nencourage both individuals and companies to use water more economically.\n\nThe water footprint of Al use\nin work environments\n\n00000006 A\n66666666\n66666666\n00000000 = y\n66666666 =¢é\n66666666\n66666666\n66666666\nSending a 100-word email generated by Sending a 100-word email written\nachatbot using GPT-4 requires without Al assistance requires\n519 millilitres of water. 8 millilitres of water.\n\nSources: A bottle of water per email: the hidden environmental costs of using Al chatbots, 2024, Pranshu Verma and\nShelly Tan; The Water Footprint of Data Centers, Sustainability (MDP1), 2015, Ristic B, Madani K and Makuch Z.",

They also\nboost energy efficiency and security of\nsupply.\n\nFirst-generation biofuels were criticised\nbecause they had a negative impact on\nfood security. This led to the develop-\nment of second-generation biofuels, which\nimprove energy efficiency, making good\nuse of non-food waste and sustainable\nraw materials. In addition, they offer a\nlow-carbon alternative to fossil fuels and\nare compatible with today’s vehicle fleets.\nAs numerous fossil fuel refineries convert\ninto biorefineries, the sector's industrial-\nisation and profitability are safeguarded.\n\nYet the sector still faces challenges such\nas fraud, mislabelling and cheaper imports.\nThe EU has responded by introducing an-\nti-dumping tariffs and has requested strict-\ner certification standards.\n\nThanks to their excellent cost/decarboni-\nsation impact ratio, biofuels are crucial for\nmeeting the EU’s sustainable aviation fuels\nmandates. Biofuels are also an essential\npart of the energy transition, while foster-\ning energy security.\n\nShedding light on the energy efficiency of green hydrogen\n\nby Alexandre Henneguelle,\nogen & Carbon Capture Expert,\n\nBNP Paribas\n\nProduced from water and renewable\npower, “green hydrogen” allows to decar-\nbonise the existing use of hydrogen as a\nfeedstock in refineries, chemical produc-\ntion plants and steelworks.\n\nConsidering its low carbon footprint, green\nhydrogen is also viewed as a potential\n6 energy carrier. As such, green hydrogen\n\ncompetes with other energy carriers across\nvarious factors including energy efficiency.\nThe energy efficiency of using green hydro-\ngen as an energy carrier can vary greatly\nfrom one application to the other due to\nspecific factors linked to production (such\nas availability of high temperature steam),\ntransportation and storage (requiring\neither compression, liquefaction or con-\nversion into other energy carriers) and use\n(with fuel cells, gas turbines or gas boil-\ners). In general, the efficiency from produc-\ntion to end use currently varies between\naround 20% to 50%.\n\nThe use of green hydrogen raises questions\nin sectors where direct electrification alter-\nnatives are available, notably residential\nheating (heat pumps are at least five times\nmore energy efficient than hydrogen boil-\ners) and automotive (battery electric solu-\ntions are at least three times more energy\nefficient than fuel cell solutions). Green\nhydrogen prospects consequently seem\nmore promising in long-distance aviation\nand shipping industries (not well suited\nto direct electrification), via conversion to\ne-fuels.\n\nSMRs enable better use of energy resources and co-generation\n\nby Mark Muldowney,\nEU Director, Low Carbon\n\nTransition Group, BNP Paribas\n\nNuclear power has long been valued for\nits ability to provide reliable, low-carbon\nbase load energy. Unlike solar or wind\nenergy, nuclear energy ensures consist-\nent power output throughout the year. As\nelectricity demand peaks in many mar-\nkets during winter afternoons and eve-\nnings, nuclear power remains a stable\nbackbone for modern grids.\n\nThe rise of small modular reactors (SMRs)\nis a promising development. They poten-\ntially offer faster more cost-effective al-\nternatives to traditional large-scale plants.\nWith a prospective lifespan of 60 to 80\nyears, these reactors are designed for ef-\nficiency, flexibility and adaptability. Their\nmodular construction should allow for\nshorter build times and improved quality\ncontrol. They range in size from less than\n1 MW to 470 MW and utilise a variety of\ndifferent technological approaches. While\nstill in early stages, over 70 small modu-\nlar reactor projects are under development\n\nacross 18 countries globally, with anticipat-\ned deployment in the 2030s\n\nSI\n\nese smaller-sized reactors hold poten-\ntial for applications beyond electricity.\ney could support district heating, hydro-\ngen and low-carbon fuel production. They\nan also be used for remote installations\nlike mines and research bases. As cli-\nmate challenges intensify, small modular\nreactors are poised to become an impor-\ntant element of global energy strategies,\nending efficiency with environmental\nresponsibility.\n\nSI\n\n°\n\nst",

They are based on the International Finance\nCorporation (IFC) Performance Standards (PS) and the World Bank Group Environmental, Health & Safety (EHS)\nGuidelines, which are comprised of both general and industry specific sets of documents. As of May 2023, 128\nfinancial institutions in 37 countries have adopted the Equator Principles\n\nLaunched in 2003, the EP enforced its fourth version (EP4) starting October 2020. In its final version, EP4\nbrought additional requirements for more sensitive projects including dedicated Human Rights and Climate\nChange Risk Assessments, broader application of the EP standards for both Designated and Non-designated\ncountries and significant changes to the financial instruments and thresholds covered by the EP.\n\nBNP Paribas adopted the EP in October 2008. This document\nconstitutes BNP Paribas’ EP Implementation Report for the year\n2023 (January 1st to December 31st) pursuant to Principle 10 of\nthe Equator Principles, which states that “the EPFI will, at least\nannually, report publicly on transactions that have reached\nFinancial Close and on its Equator Principles implementation\nprocesses and experience”:.\n\nWhile this reporting is in line with the Minimum Reporting\nRequirements detailed in Annex B of the Equator Principles,\nthe official reporting information is publicly available on the EP\nAssociation website.\n\n02 EQUATOR PRINCIPLES IMPLEMENTATION REPORT 2023",

    "chunk": "Environmental performance of partner\ninstitutions\n\nCommitted for many years to the transition to a low-carbon and environmentally\nfriendly economy, BNP Paribas elected to expand its scope of analysis for this report,\nfor the first time looking at the environmental impact of its partner microfinance\ninstitutions.\n\nThe MESIS methodology added three new indicators in the \"Microfinance and\nEntrepreneurship Support\" and “Environmental Protection and Responsible\nConsumption\" fields. These indicators shed light on the impact of MFI financial\nactivities on the climate, biodiversity and customer vulnerability to climate change\nand biodiversity erosion.\n\nThe choice of indicators was made in partnership with the Just Sustainability\nTransitions? (JuST Institute), a non-profit co-founded by BNP Paribas and supported\nby the Global Environment Fund (GEF). The JuST Institute coordinates the initiatives\nof transition funding providers and gives them appropriate tools to help populations\nmost vulnerable to climate change and biodiversity degradation.\n\nCollecting these new environmental indicators has shown that environmental\nperformance is secondary to the objectives of our MFI partners, which tend to\nfocus more on their social performance. Note that there is a significant disparity\nbetween emerging and mature countries. In mature countries, the formalisation\nof environmental policy needs to be further developed.\n\nOur main conclusions:\n\n= 25% of MFls surveyed report a portfolio of green loans totalling €36 million.\n\n= 25% of MFIs surveyed have implemented an environmental strategy and are\ntaking action to reduce the associated risks.\n\n= 30% of MFls surveyed say they assess their portfolio's environmental risk;\nhalf of the MFI portfolio is deemed to have a low environmental risk.\n\n+https://justinstitute.org/\n\n>\n\nIndicators\n\nThese indicators were developed in line with the indicators of the Green Index 3.0‘ from the e-MFP Green\nInclusive and Climate Smart Finance Action Group. They are aligned with the four core standards of\ninclusive green finance, and in particular, with the assessment of environmental strategy, environmental\nrisk management and green products.\n\nfhttps:/Awww.e-mfp.eu/green-index]\n\nENVIRONMENTAL OBJECTIVES fl\n\nDoes the microfinance institution have a documented strategy specifying its\nintention to achieve the following environmental objectives:\n\n= Reduce the negative impact of its customers on the environment\n\n= Reduce customer vulnerability to climate change and environmental\ndegradation\n\n= Reduce customers’ negative impact on the environment\n\n= Promote the adoption of green practices and technologies and meet customer\nrequests/needs\n\nPOTENTIAL BORROWER ENVIRONMENTAL RISK ASSESSMENT\n\nLoan portfolio, in volume and % terms, with high environmental risk -> two response\nfields for each risk category:\n\n= one for the gross amount of the Loan portfolio\n\n= one for the % of the loan portfolio\nLoan portfolio, in volume and % terms, with medium environmental risk\nLoan portfolio, in volume and % terms, with low environmental risk\n\nWhat percentage of the MFIl’s gross loan portfolio finances green practices\nor technologies such as:\n\n= Renewable energies\n\n= Energy efficiency\n\n= Sustainable agriculture\n\n= Clean water and sanitation\n\n= Circular economy\n\n= Sustainable mobility",

To offer tailor-made\nfinancing to actors of the Social and Solidarity Economy (SSE) so that they can implement\nexperimental solutions that respond to social or environmental issues. The team supports\nprojects throughout their entire lifecycle, from conception to implementation - and often\nbeyond.\n\nHow does an IB work? These experimental programmes carried out by social operators (companies, NGOs,\nfoundations) are pre-financed by investors, who will be reimbursed in full or in part by public authorities\nsuch as the State depending on the achievement of the impact objectives set forth and objectively assessed\nby an independent evaluator. These impact objectives, when achieved, make it possible for the public\nauthority involved to generate savings. Part of these savings can then be allocated to the reimbursement and\nremuneration of investors for the financial risk that they took on when financing this experimental project.\nulti-party, multi-dimensional, and multi-faceted, IBs are a unique collaboration to finance societal\ninnovation, a lever for the systemic development of public policies, a way to professionalize social action, and\na driver for encouraging a culture of objective, independent evaluation for NGOs and the public sector.\nmpact measurement, the keystone of this approach, makes it possible to constantly readjust the\nimplementation of projects on the ground to ensure their effectiveness. It also guarantees that the interests\nof all parties involved are well-aligned. What is the ideal outcome of an |B? If successful, everyone wins:\nthe social operator has validated the efficiency of its model without taking any financial risk, investors are\nreimbursed for their investment, and the State can now turn the experimental project into public policy now\nthat the IB has justified the project's added societal value in relation to its cost.\n\nTHE IMPACT BOND MODEL\n\nGp Investors reimbursed according to the measurement oY\n\nof the payment indicators.
