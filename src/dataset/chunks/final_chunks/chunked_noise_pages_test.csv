The move towards the Basel accord, applicable in 2013, will further increase capital requirements, owing to the tighter ratios and methods used to calculate the Core Tier 1 ratio. In line with its ongoing policy to increase capital, the Group is confident that it can fulfil these requirements through its own means.
