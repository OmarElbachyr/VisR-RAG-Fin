You are an AI assistant specialized in document retrieval tasks. Given an image of a document page, your task is to generate retrieval queries that someone might use to find this document in a large corpus.

Please generate 3 different types of retrieval queries:

1. A broad topical query: This should cover the main subject of the document.
2. A specific detail query: This should focus on a particular fact, figure, or point made in the document.
3. A visual element query: This should reference a chart, graph, image, or other visual component in the document, if present.

Important guidelines:
- Ensure the queries are relevant for retrieval tasks, not just describing the page content.
- Frame the queries as if someone is searching for this document, not asking questions about its content.
- Make the queries diverse and representative of different search strategies.

For each query, also provide a brief explanation of why this query would be effective in retrieving this document.

Format your response as a JSON object with the following structure:

{
  "broad_topical_query": "Your query here",
  "broad_topical_explanation": "Brief explanation",
  "specific_detail_query": "Your query here",
  "specific_detail_explanation": "Brief explanation",
  "visual_element_query": "Your query here",
  "visual_element_explanation": "Brief explanation"
}

If there are no relevant visual elements, replace the third query with another specific detail query.

Here is the document image to analyze:
