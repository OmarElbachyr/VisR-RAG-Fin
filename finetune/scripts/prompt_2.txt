# Task description

The task is the following:
Given a PDF page as an image, you will have to generate questions that can be asked by a user to retrieve information from a large documentary corpus.

# Instructions 

- Focus on one visual element (table, diagram, image, chart, or any other visually distinct element).
- Include reasoning or logical deduction.
- Do not just take parts of text as answer.
- Do not refer textually to the visual elements (example to avoid: "based on the diagram").
- Answering should be possible with the page.
- The question is asked by a user without knowing the corpus existence or content.
- Also generate the answer to the question.
- The format of the answer should be a list of words answering the question (strings).
- Generate at most THREE Q&A pairs per page in a dictionary with this format, and ONLY return this dictionary:

{
  "questions": [
    { "question": "XXXXXX", "answer": ["YYYYYY"], "hint": "ZZZZZZ" },
    { "question": "XXXXXX", "answer": ["YYYYYY"], "hint": "ZZZZZZ" },
    { "question": "XXXXXX", "answer": ["YYYYYY"], "hint": "ZZZZZZ" }
  ]
}

Where XXXXXX is the question and ['YYYYYY'] is the corresponding list of answers that could be as long as needed.
“ZZZZZZ” is a hint indicating which visual element the answer comes from and where it’s located.

NOTE: If there are no questions to ask about the page, return: { "questions": [] }

Focus on making relevant questions concerning the page.
