Bollenbacher, “Observations to end March 2022,” Scripps Institution of Oceanography: Scripps CO2 Program,\nhttps://scrippsco2.ucsd.edu/data/atmospheric_co2/primary mlo_co2_record.htm\n\nBy contrast, the science of natural capital is inevitably about the broader ecosystem, as well as\nindividual facets of the system; it incorporates human society through what is known as the “web of\nlife.” We think this is why milestones on the science-policy path of natural capital preservation, set out\nin early documents, tend to be geared toward the broader idea of human well-being within the overall\nwell-being of the biosphere.\n\nTake the UN-driven Millennium Ecosystem Assessment (2001-2005). It aimed to “assess the\nconsequences of ecosystem change for human well-being and the scientific basis for action needed to\nenhance the conservation and sustainable use of those systems and their contribution to human well-\nbeing.” It described ecosystem services as:\n\nN\n\n(2) Supporting YY Regulating\n(TY)\n\n)\n\n| Cultural\n\nTL Provisioning | |\n\nCollectively, ecosystem services connect the biosphere to all activities of everyday life. So, supporting\necosystem services (such as soil formation) facilitate the delivery of other essential types of services.\nProvisioning services for example, furnish humans with food, water, and fuel, along with all the\nmaterials that human society uses in creative ways (e.g., genetics). Regulating services include air\ntemperature and quality, and water quality. Cultural services cover intangibles such as knowledge\nsystems, aesthetic values and social relations. It’s clear that none of these systems can exist in isolation.\nA compromise to the functioning of one is a threat to all.\n\nThe UBS Sustainability and Impact Institute",
